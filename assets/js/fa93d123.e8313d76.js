In nearly all blockchains, the block producers can decide which new transactions they prefer to include and confirm in the blocks they produce.

This is also seen as a form of centralization in blockchains, as you need middlemen that process your transactions. Regular users are not allowed to write directly to the ledger. That leads to the well-known "miner race," where only the miner with the highest computational processing power, or stakers with the highest stake, have a reasonable chance of becoming a block producer and are allowed to attach a new block including their proccessed transactions to the ledger.
