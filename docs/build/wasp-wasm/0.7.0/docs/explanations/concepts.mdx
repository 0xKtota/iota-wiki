# Call Context

Understanding the call context is vital in leveraging the Wasm code within a sandboxed host environment effectively. Let's delve into the distinction between different function calls and the role of WasmLib in setting up a smart contract.

## Function Calls: Func and View

Smart contract function calls come in two types, each having specific access levels to the smart contract state:

### Func

Grants full mutable access, resulting in a state update. It accommodates both on-ledger and off-ledger requests, finalized once the state update is registered in the Tangle ledger.

### View

Permits limited immutable access, thus no state update occurs. Ideal for quickly querying the contract's current state, it only facilitates off-ledger calls.

WasmLib offers distinct contexts for these function types, namely `ScFuncContext` for Func and `ScViewContext` for View, controlling the accessible functionality and enforcing usage constraints through compile-time type-checking.

## Smart Contract Setup with WasmLib

You will need the following to set up a smart contract:

- **Defining Funcs and Views**: Outline available Funcs and Views and communicate them to the host through WasmLib. It ensures correct dispatch of function calls and maintains necessary restrictions.
- **Parameter and Return Value Determination**: Establish the parameters and return values for each function. ISC uses simple dictionaries to store details, necessitating consistent (de)serialization handled adeptly by WasmLib.
- **Utilizing Schema Tool**: Although WasmLib can be used directly, the Schema Tool is recommended for automatically generating and updating the smart contract framework in a type-safe manner, using the preferred language.

Grasping these concepts will facilitate a secure and efficient smart contract setup, steering clear of potential pitfalls while making the most of what WasmLib offers.
