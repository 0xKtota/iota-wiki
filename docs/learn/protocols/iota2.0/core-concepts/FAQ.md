# Frequently Asked Questions

## Accounts

<details> 
    <summary>What is an account and what do I need it for?</summary>  
    An account is a central component of the IOTA ledger, essential if you wish to write transactions into the Tangle, stake or delegate. 
    An IOTA account is completely unrelated to any know-your-customer (KYC) measures.
    It is always possible to transact without creating an account; 
    however, in this case, you’ll need someone else (or a service provider) to issue blocks for you. 
    In this case, you might need to pay for this service; thus, you are only guaranteed to have the right to feelessness if you own an account with Mana associated with it.
    Furthermore, it is possible for exchanges to create an IOTA account for you, but you should ask directly to your exchange if they provide this service.
</details>

<details> 
    <summary>How do I get an account? </summary>  
    You can create an account following the instructions in the Firefly wallet. 
    Note that, depending on your balance, you might need to wait a couple of minutes before this process is completed. 
    Furthermore, it is possible for exchanges to create an IOTA account for you, but you should ask directly to your exchange if they provide this service.
</details>

<details> 
    <summary>Is my account automatically enabled to issue blocks?</summary> 
    You should enable the Block issuer feature from the account after depositing additional tokens in the account output. 
    This deposit is used as an anti-spam mechanism and can be recovered in the case you wish to destroy the account.
    The Firefly wallet enables the Block Issuer Feat automatically, so the regular Firefly user does not need to worry about this.
</details>

<details> 
    <summary>Is my account automatically enabled to delegate?</summary> 
    Delegation is completely separate from accounts or block issuance. 
    Delegation is done through dedicated Delegation Outputs which may or may not be owned by accounts. 
    However, to create such a Delegation Output yourself, you will need a block issuer account.
    This way, any block issuer is automatically enabled to delegate.
</details>

<details> 
    <summary>Is my account automatically enabled to validate?</summary> 
    You should add a Staking Feature to your account if you want to validate.
    The presence of a Staking Feature on an account is what signals that this account wants to participate in the validation of the network. 
    Accounts with this feature are also referred to as stakers or registered validators and are eligible to be selected into the validator committee.
</details>


## Mana 

<details> 
    <summary>What is Mana?</summary>  
    Mana is the asset used to interact with the network. 
    Mana permits users to issue blocks while guaranteeing that the available network capacity is shared fairly (i.e., proportionally to the Mana holdings). 
    In the future, Mana will also be used to enable smart contract executions.
</details>

<details> 
    <summary>How can I get Mana?</summary>  
    You will get Mana by default just by holding tokens.
    IOTA tokens generate IOTAMana at a rate of around 0.066 IOTAMana per IOTA per day.
    Shimmer tokens generate ShimmerMana at a rate around 0.132 ShimmerMana per Shimmer per day (rememeber that under low congestion, a default block will require 0.001 Mana to be issued).
    Additionally, you can get additional Mana by performing consensus-related activities, i.e., by being a validator or even delegating your tokens to a validator.
    If for some reason you need more Mana than the amount generated by these activities, you can always buy Mana from another user.
    However, the number of tokens you hold will always be enough to guarantee a certain share of the network tps.
</details>

<details> 
    <summary>Will the Mana generated by my tokens be automatically sent to me?</summary>  
    You’ll be able to mint the Mana owed to you whenever you consume the outputs related to this generation. 
    This Mana will not appear automatically in your account without doing this process. 
    Your wallet should automatically calculate the value of your generated Mana.
</details>

<details> 
    <summary>Can I use the Mana generated by my IOTA holdings to transact in the Shimmer Network?</summary> 
    No. The Mana generated in the IOTA network is unrelated to the Mana in the Shimmer network, since they live in different ledgers. 
    We call these two assets “IOTAMana” and “ShimmerMana”, respectively.
</details>

<details> 
    <summary>Why did my Mana balance decrease in the wallet?</summary>  
    While you hold your IOTA/Shimmer tokens, your balance will not decrease since the Mana generation in your wallet compensates for the decay of this Mana.
    However, if you sell part of your tokens, the Mana generation rate may temporarily not compensate for the Mana decay. 
    Similarly, if you don't hold any tokens, your Mana balance will decay by 30% of your balance per year.
</details>

<details> 
    <summary>Why is there a mana decay?</summary>  
    We incentivize continuous and ongoing collaboration with security and consensus. 
    Thus, our incentivization scheme ensures that any participant who stops their collaboration will have the reward they got for their participation (i.e., the Mana they accumulated in the period) considered less valuable as time passes. 
    This means that actors with less “skin in the game” will automatically and gradually lose their influence and access to the system.
</details>

<details> 
    <summary>What does it mean to “allot” Mana?</summary>  
    Users should not worry about the process of allotting Mana since it’s something done automatically by the wallet. 
    However, technically, Mana can be either stored in UTXOs, as any regular token, or being associated with an account. 
    We call the process of moving Mana from an UTXO to an account as “allotting” the Mana. 
    Whenever you create a block containing a transaction, the wallet will automatically allot Mana from your UTXO balance to your account balance, and burn this Mana from your account in the same block.
    We reiterate that users should not worry about this process, since users do not have the need to manually allot Mana. 
    This option exists under the advanced settings of the wallet just in case someone wants to build a service that demands this possibility.
    Furthermore, any Mana that was manually allotted cannot be moved back to its UTXO form, or moved between accounts.
</details>

<details> 
    <summary>Is Mana a soul-bound token?</summary>  
    No. Mana can be freely moved (unless it was manually allotted to an account).
</details>

## Usability

<details> 
    <summary>Who can issue a block?</summary>  
    To become block creators, users must register an account (through the wallet) and activate the “Block Issuer Feature”, which requires a certain storage deposit. 
    Note that this account registration does not involve any type of KYC, it’s simply a signing procedure with your keys.
</details>

<details> 
    <summary>How much Mana will I need to burn to create a single block? </summary>  
    The actual Mana required per block will depend on the traffic conditions and the block's characteristics (block length, number of references, etc.). 
    The protocol sets a minimum cost of around 0.001 Mana to prevent spam (the actual value may change depending on the results of the upcoming tests in the DevNet). 
    We expect the Mana burnt per block to be close to this minimum value during the early stages of the network. 
    See the Mana Calculator https://wiki.iota.org/learn/protocols/iota2.0/core-concepts/mana-calculator/ for more information.
</details>

<details> 
    <summary>Why don’t we use fees in the base token (IOTA/Shimmer) like in the other DLTs?</summary>  
    Mana is self-replenishable, meaning that anyone holding IOTA/Shimmer tokens will be guaranteed a particular share of the Mana being generated in the system. 
    Thus, any participant who holds tokens can issue blocks and transactions without paying in the base token. 
    This ensures a frictionless system, where your share of base token in the system does not change based on your activity (unlike the usual fee-based system, where each time you send a transaction, you see your token holdings diminishing).
</details>

<details> 
    <summary>What will be my APY if I stake my IOTAs?</summary>  
    We don’t measure APYs since users get rewarded through Mana, i.e., by accessing a particular share of the available throughput. 
    In the future, we expect such a share of throughput to become valuable as more and more users want to write into the IOTA ledger.
</details>

<details> 
    <summary>What will be my TPS?</summary>  
    The number of blocks that can be generated will depend on the Mana holdings and the real-time traffic. 
    However, our congestion control mechanism guarantees the maximum possible share of the available throughput compared to online users. 
    In the following, we estimate the early stages (uncongested network) and permanent regime (stabiloty price)  minimum tps for token holders, delegators, and validators. 
    The tables also shows how much time is needed to generate enough Mana to create a block in a given scenario, depending on the IOTA/Shimmer tokens held.

</details>

<details> 
    <summary>What does it mean to have network congestion?</summary>  
    Network congestion refers to the situation where the rate of newly created blocks is larger than the network's target throughput, representing how many blocks per second the network can handle. 
    The target throughput is set at the protocol level. 
    To be precise, we measure the throughput in work per second as blocks may be of different sizes and require various processing efforts.
</details>

<details> 
    <summary>How does network congestion impact the user?</summary>  
    Unlike most projects where congestion triggers expensive races (for instance, mining races or first-price auctions), in IOTA, users only have to pay the set price to issue their block. 
    The price can potentially increase due to sustained congestion, but it will not experience spikes due to priority fees. 
    Instead, the congestion control will automatically and fairly allocate the available throughput according to the Mana holdings. During heavy congestion, this may result in a TPS temporarily lower than usual. 
</details>

<details> 
    <summary>Is my Block guaranteed to confirm if I post the required Mana for that period?</summary>
    Under normal circumstances, yes. 
    However, as in any other DLT, this cannot be guaranteed in extreme cases. 
    For that reason, we suggest the user to use the rate setter, explained in [our Wiki](https://wiki.iota.org/learn/protocols/iota2.0/core-concepts/communication-layer/#icca-during-high-traffic-periods), to minimize this probability to the minimum possible.
    The firefly wallet supports this rate setter.
</details>

<details> 
    <summary>Can I burn more Mana to make my tx go faster?</summary>  
    No. The protocol sets the amount of Mana to be burnt to issue a block. 
    Your block won’t be confirmed faster if you try to burn more Mana than the fixed price. 
    If your block burns less Mana than the required, it won’t be propagated.
</details>

<details> 
    <summary>If I have enough Mana, why can’t I issue blocks?</summary>  
    You should enable the Block issuer feature from the account after depositing additional tokens in the account output. 
    This deposit is used as an anti-spam mechanism and can be recovered in the case you wish to destroy the account.
    The Firefly wallet enables the Block Issuer Feat automatically, so the regular Firefly user does not need to worry about this.
</details>

<details> 
    <summary>What if I don’t have enough Mana to issue my block?</summary>  
    If the user does not have time constraints, they can wait some time to generate enough Mana to issue a block. 
    Otherwise, they can either acquire Mana accumulated by other accounts or contact a third-party node to create the block for them (or to create a block containing a transaction that sends you Mana). 
    This third party might charge for this service. 
</details>

<details> 
    <summary>Shall I pay the service provider?</summary>  
    A service provider is likely to charge some amount to provide its service. 
    At the early stages, we expect most service providers to do this in an altruistic form to promote the adoption of the IOTA network for users who do not have or do not want to set up an account; in this case, they can offer this service for free or ask for a fee in Mana. 
    At a later stage, once access becomes valuable, we expect that paid services will arise according to the market needs.
</details>

## Delegation

<details> 
    <summary>Do I have to run a node to participate in consensus?</summary>  
    No. It is possible to delegate your stake to existing validators.
</details>

<details> 
    <summary>Can the validator refuse my delegation?</summary>  
    No. The registration as a validator is public and contains all information needed to delegate tokens to them. Validators have no control over whom and how much is being delegated to them.
</details>
    
<details> 
    <summary>How do I choose a validator?</summary>  
    You can always calculate in advance how much profit you are expected to get depending on the validator you choose (for more on that, see our [Mana Calculator](https://wiki.iota.org/learn/protocols/iota2.0/core-concepts/mana-calculator/)). 
    Thus, your validator selection process should combine profit maximization and your trust in said validator. 
    Remember that you are not only getting rewards but also delegating your voting power to the validator! Ultimately (even though your funds are not technically at risk), the network's utility depends on its security level, so delegating to untrustful validators might decrease the value of your investment in the long run. 
</details>

<details> 
    <summary>Should I always delegate to the pool/validator with the highest profitability?</summary>  
    It depends. 
    You should consistently weigh profit vs trust. 
    Some validators might give you more rewards, but you might not trust them for some reason (or vice-versa). 
    Always carefully consider both factors when delegating your funds (even though your funds are not technically at risk).
</details>

<details> 
    <summary>How much more Mana can I get?</summary>  
    It is mathematically guaranteed that there is always a validator that, if you delegate to it, you can generate at least two times as much Mana than simple token holders (assuming that this validator performs its duties correctly).
</details>

<details> 
    <summary>Will my delegated tokens be locked?</summary>  
    No, you can move your tokens at any point in time. Rewards will be computed as if you had moved the tokens at the end of the epoch.
</details>

<details> 
    <summary>Can my delegated tokens be slashed?</summary>  
    No, delegators won't get their tokens slashed.
</details>

<details> 
    <summary>Will the validator have any control over my delegated tokens?</summary>  
    No. Delegating tokens to validators just means that you are signaling that they will use your voting power. They have no control over your funds.
</details>

<details> 
    <summary>What if my validator goes offline?</summary>  
    The delegator has the possibility to change and choose a new validator.
</details>

<details> 
    <summary>How do I change validators?</summary> 
    To change validators you should just consume your Delegation output and create a new one including the ID of the new validator.
</details>

<details> 
    <summary>Will I get my rewards automatically as a delegator?</summary>  
    As in the case of Mana generation by holding, whenever you consume your delegation output, you’ll be able to mint the Mana owed to you as reward for delegation. 
    The rewards will not appear automatically in your account without doing this process. 
    Note that, unlike in the case of Mana generated by holding tokens, there is an expiration period for claiming rewards, since nodes do not store rewards for longer than this period. 
    Your wallet should automatically calculate the value of your rewards.
</details>

<details> 
    <summary>How long will the expiration period for claiming delegation rewards be?</summary>  
    One year. 
    Nodes do not store Mana rewards for longer than this period, so the network will reject a transaction claiming any rewards that are older than one year.
</details>

## Staking and Validating

<details>      
    <summary>What do I gain for being a validator?</summary> 
    First of all, you will be contributing for the security and decentralization of the network. 
    You will also get additional Mana, compared to what you would get if you just held the tokens, or if you just delegated them.
    This additional Mana is divided into what we call “fixed costs” and “profit margin”.
</details>  
    
<details>      
    <summary>What are the validator's fixed costs?</summary>       
    The validator sets a fixed value to cover fixed costs (e.g., related to machines, electricity) at registration, which has to be reasonably low. 
    Since fixed costs are public and defined at registration, delegators will tend not to choose validators with unreasonably high fixed costs. 
    Additionally, if a validator's fixed cost is too high (technically speaking, if it’s larger than their calculated reward in a particular epoch), as a form of punishment, no reward will be distributed to the pool at all in this epoch.
</details>  
    
<details>      
    <summary>What is the validator profit margin?</summary>   
    The validator profit margin is a value set by the protocol to define the minimum additional Mana to be distributed to validators.
    Because of this protocol-set margin, active validators correctly performing their duties will always generate at least three times as much Mana than simple token holders. 
</details>  
    
<details>      
    <summary>How can I become a validator?</summary>       
    You must run a node and register as a validator. 
    You will be added to the list of validators, and accounts can delegate their stake to you. 
    Then, based on your stake and the stake delegated to you, you’ll have a chance to be selected for the committee. 
    If you are chosen and perform your validation duties correctly, you (and whoever delegated to you) will be rewarded accordingly. For more information, see our[Mana Calculator](https://wiki.iota.org/learn/protocols/iota2.0/core-concepts/mana-calculator/).
</details>  
    
<details>      
    <summary>Do I have to lock tokens to become a validator? </summary>       
    Technically, no. 
    However, locking tokens (besides increasing your chance to be selected for the committee) increases your rewards compared to delegating these tokens to yourself. 
    Additionally, the more tokens you lock, the more tokens you’ll tend to have delegated to you (for more in that dynamics, see the [Incentives Whitepaper](https://files.iota.org/papers/IOTA_2.0_Incentives_And_Tokenomics_Whitepaper.pdf)).
</details>  
    
<details>      
    <summary>For how long must a validator lock its tokens?</summary>       
    A validator can choose for how long it will stake its tokens. 
    A validator will only be eligible to be part of the committee in epochs in which its tokens are still locked.  There is no maximum amount of time to lock your tokens.
</details>  
    
<details>      
    <summary>How exactly do I register as a validator?</summary>
    To register as a validator, an actor has to add a Staking Feature to their account.
    This Feature locks a user-chosen amount of IOTA coins until a user-chosen End Epoch. 
    The registration must also provide a fixed cost (a fixed amount deducted per epoch to cover the validator’s fixed operating costs).
</details>  
    
<details>      
    <summary>Which are the validator duties?</summary>       
    Validators must be online and timely issue validation blocks. 
    The validator rewards will be proportional to the validator performance factor, which measures if this duty was done correctly. 
</details>  
    
<details>      
    <summary>What if I don’t perform my validation duties?</summary>       
    In this case, you and your delegators don't get rewards. 
    If you partially perform your duties, you and your delegators will get less rewards than if you performed them totally. 
</details>  
    
<details>      
    <summary>Can my locked tokens be slashed?</summary>       
    No, slashing is not present at the moment in IOTA 2.0. 
    Rewards, on the other hand, won’t be distributed to validators that don't perform their validation duties correctly.
</details>  
    
<details>      
    <summary>How do I maximize profit if I’m a validator?</summary>       
    The optimal strategy to maximize the profit is to stake all your IOTA tokens, as the Mana generation is proportional to the amount staked, and perform your duties correctly.
</details>  
    
<details>      
    <summary>Will I get my rewards automatically as a validator?</summary>       
    Your rewards will not appear automatically in your account. To claim your validator rewards, you must consume your validator feature and mint your owed Mana rewards. 
    You don’t have to stop being a validator for claiming rewards, since you can always add a new staking feature at the same time you consume you old one.
    You will not lose your delegators by changing staking features, since delegation is defined by the Validator ID, which does is not modified by changes in the staking feature.
    Note that, there is an expiration period for claiming rewards, since nodes do not store rewards for longer than this period. Your wallet should automatically calculate the value of your rewards.
</details>  
    
<details>      
    <summary>How long will the expiration period for claiming validator’s rewards be?</summary>       
    One year. 
    Nodes do not store Mana rewards for longer than this period, so the network will reject a transaction claiming rewards that are older than one year.
